# ðŸ“Š ChatGPT Positioning Strategy â€“ Advanced Marketing Analytics Final Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes the **positioning of ChatGPT** in comparison with competing AI tools such as **DeepSeek, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude**, using survey-based perceptual and preference data.  
The study was conducted as part of the **Advanced Marketing Analytics** course, leveraging **Python (analytics + visualization)** and **Enginius (marketing analytics software)**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Evaluate ChatGPTâ€™s competitive position in the AI assistant market.  
- Identify **key perceptual attributes** (Ease of Use, Speed of Response, Accuracy, Innovation, Creativity, Trustworthiness).  
- Derive a **positioning map** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**.  
- Segment users based on preference data and usage behavior.  
- Recommend strategies for **sustaining market leadership** and addressing weaknesses.

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Methodology
- **Python** â†’ Data cleaning, statistical analysis, PCA, clustering, visualization.  
- **Enginius** â†’ Positioning map derivation, segmentation, perceptual/preference analysis.  
- **Survey Data** â†’ Google Forms, 75 responses (39 valid after cleaning).  

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Insights
- **ChatGPT leads** the market in *Ease of Use* and *Speed of Response*, explaining **99.8% of perceptual variance**.  
- ChatGPT has the **highest preference score (7.74)** compared to Copilot (4.18), DeepSeek (3.92), Gemini (â‰ˆ3), and Claude (3.46).  
- **Trustworthiness** is a weakness across all AI models, including ChatGPT, offering a clear opportunity for differentiation.  
- **Cluster analysis** revealed three user segments:  
  - **Enthusiasts** â†’ Strong loyalty to ChatGPT.  
  - **Multi-Model Users** â†’ Open to competitors.  
  - **Low-Engagement Users** â†’ Weak preference for any AI tool.
